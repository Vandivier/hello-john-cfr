Cloudformation + React = Serverless Starter ðŸ’•ðŸ”¥

# Miscellaneous Notes

1. Start by following https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/quick-start/
    1. `npm install -g serverless`
    2. Made IAM user with name serverless-test, per [video instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KngM5bfpttA).
    3. convention: keep credentials.csv in root folder. It will be gitignored.
    4. convention: Title case i/o lambda function naming. No hungarian, no dashes. eg `UserInfoBySession`
        1. dashes are bad bc verbose enough to create name conflicts. serverless transforms `user-info-by-session` to `ApiGatewayResourceGetDashuserDashinfoDashbyDashsession`
        2. serverless mutates case, defeating hungarian. `fGetUserInfoBySession` to `FGetUserInfoBySessionLambdaPermissionApiGateway`
        3. Specifying method isn't restful.
2. targeting create-react-app as static site in S3
    1. ref: https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment
    2. ref: https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/pre-rendering-into-static-html-files
3. basic flow
    1. land on home page, you are a guest.
    2. say hello guest.
    3. optionally, log in (as john, only seeded user)
    4. then, say hello john by fetching user info.
    5. john has option to create new users who can then log in and see hello to them.
4. to be express like or nah?
    1. ref: https://serverless.com/blog/serverless-express-rest-api/
    2. note serverless-offline discussed above for local dev
5. Testing
    1. Unit via Jest, or fall back to mocha. ref: https://serverless.com/blog/unit-testing-nodejs-serverless-jest/
    2. E2e via Cypress.
    3. Client also in Jest.
6. Automate UI deployment to S3
    1. Looks like `npm serverless` doesn't do this.
    2. Quick and easy route forward is aws cli from local, but this isn't really CICD
    3. Less quick and easy, but true CICD, is spelled out below:
        1. ref: https://stackoverflow.com/a/54546873/3931488
        2. Notice it's dependent on git host. Github, Bitbucket, GitLab, and more are supported, but implementation is heterogenous
        3. This repo will use a Github-oriented implementation but this starter can be modded for the other repo hosts.

7. It's currently a goal to remain create-react-app compliant without ejection
    1. this is why we have, eg, /ui/src/services instead of /ui/services which i would normally do
